    "The first two print statements will print correctly. The last print statement (`Television.model()`) will result in a `TypeError`, as it is not a class method, and requires an argument to be passed to `self` during invocation, hich means it needs to be called from within the context of an instantiated Television object, not called directly as it is here.\n"
