    "### Advanced OOP Design Challenge (Difficulty: Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Design and implement a complete object-oriented library management system in Python. Your system should include:\n",
    "1.  A `Library` class that manages the overall collection of books\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A `Book` class to represent individual books\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  A `Member` class to represent library members\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  A `Transaction` class to handle checkouts and returns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your implementation should demonstrate:\n",
    "- Proper class hierarchy and relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation of appropriate data and behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism through method overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance where appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class methods and/or static methods where they make sense\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use of instance methods for object-specific behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Requirements:\n",
    "1.  `​Book` class​:\n",
    "    - Should track title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Should include methods to mark as checked out or returned\n",
    "2.  `​Member` class​:\n",
    "    - Should track name, ID, and currently borrowed books\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Should include methods to check out and return books\n",
    "3.  `​Library` class​:\n",
    "    - Should maintain collections of books and members\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Should provide methods to add books, register members, and handle transactions\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Should include search functionality to find books by various criteria\n",
    "4.  ​`Transaction` class​:\n",
    "    - Should record details about checkouts and returns\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Should include transaction date, book, member, and type (checkout or return)\n",
    "#### Additional Requirements:\n",
    "- Include proper validation and error handling (e.g., can't check out an already checked-out book)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement at least one example of method overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include appropriate __str__ and __repr__ methods for your classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate understanding of when to use class variables vs instance variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include a demo script that shows how the system works with example data"
